# Localisation Guide

<IntroParagraph>

Welcome to the Culture Amp Localisation 'Getting Started' guide. We hope that the following information will provide you with adequate technical knowledge on how we do localisation at Culture Amp. If you believe something is missing or could be improved, please feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/cultureamp/cultureamp-style-guide).

</IntroParagraph>

## Overview

As the Culture Amp product/s mature and grow, we want to be able to support as many languages as needed. Aside from the obvious language changes required, certain languages such as Arabic and Hebrew also require that our user interfaces support different directional layouts e.g. _right-to-left (RTL)_. The guidelines below outline some of the core approaches we can take to ensure we cater for languages that need RTL support.

<InlineNotification persistent={true} type="affirmative">

**Tip:** It is a good idea to start thinking about the horizontal flow of a layout in terms of `start` and `end` as opposed to `left` and `right`. This will help you determine where you need to cater for RTL layout support. CSS [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) takes this approach and uses `flex-start` and `flex-end` for positioning elements within a flex container. Wherever possible, start using flexbox for your layout and you will find you get a lot of RTL support for free!

## Getting Started

Culture Amp have a number of [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) mixins which are available from [Kaizen](https://github.com/cultureamp/cultureamp-style-guide) for you to use. To use them, you will need to ensure the correct mixin file is imported.

## Text Alignment

If you explicity need to set the `text-align` property for your document or component, you should use the `ca-type-align-start` or `ca-type-align-end` mixin as follows. As an example, using `ca-type-align-start` in a left-to-right layout will result in left-aligned text, whereas in a right-to-left layout, the resulting text will be right-aligned.

##### Available Mixins

| Name                | Description                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ca-type-align-start | left-aligned text in **LTR** or right-aligned text in **RTL** |
| ca-type-align-end   | right-aligned text in **LTR** or left-aligned text in **RTL** |

## Margins/Padding/Position

When using any `left` or `right`-specific CSS properties e.g. `margin-left`, `padding-left`, `left`, and so on, it is very common to need these values 'flipped' in an RTL layout. To help with this, the following mixins are available.

<InlineNotification persistent={true} type="informative">

**Note:** These mixins also take a `$top` and `$bottom` value. While these values are never 'flipped', they can be supplied to the mixin, which will avoid any CSS rules being overwritten.
