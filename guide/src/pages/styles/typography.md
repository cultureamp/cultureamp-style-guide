# Typography

<IntroParagraph>

Typography is important when establishing a strong design system. When established, it can help to create balance and hierarchy of textual information. By creating structure within a page, text becomes enjoyable and appealing to read. We aim to ensure type within our product complies with WCAG 2.0 AA standards.

</IntroParagraph>

## What is its purpose?

* Create visual hierarchy of textual information

## Why is it useful?

* Makes reading text enjoyable / appealing / legible
* Creates structure within a page

## How should we use it?

* Comply with WCAG 2.0 AA standards (12px minimum, 16px / 1em standard)
* Utilise brand typefaces (Open Sans → Ideal Sans (Sans Serif) and Monaco → Operator (Monospace))
* Text colour / contrast is crucial. Ensure colour ratios comply with WCAG 2.0 AA
* Adhere to our baseline grid (line-height) of 24px / Vertical rhythm
* Ensure paragraph widths are not too long (650px wide max or 90 characters)
* White space is equally important. Let your text breathe.
* Use type styles to define content structure (Page titles, Intro Lede, Body, Small etc)
* Render correctly (i.e. not janky) across all devices and operating systems.
