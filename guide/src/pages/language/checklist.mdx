# Product Writing Checklist

Need more info on any of these points? See the Writing Advice section in the <Link to="/language#tighten-up-your-text">Product Language Style Guide</Link>.

* Talk about people, not the product.
* Talk about what the user needs to do, not what they’ve just done.
* Use positive language rather than negative.
* Cut text that’s there to be polite.
* Shorten or break up sentences.
* Check that each word agrees with what’s in the interface and the product lexicon.
* Find simpler alternatives for words that aren’t CA-specific.
* Make the tense consistent.
* Remove -ing verbs.
* Make the text active, not passive.
* Check that you’ve used American English.
* Check punctuation and other General Styles.
* Check the text’s readability score — aim for Grade 7.
* Show your text to a friend in design for a sanity check (have the courage to be vulnerable!).
