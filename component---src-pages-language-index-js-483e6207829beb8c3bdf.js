However, the writing advice is intended primarily for\nuse by people who are not professional writers.\n\n## Table of contents\n\n* Culture Amp: brand tone and design principles\n  * Moments of delight and language\n  * Asking Product Writers for help\n* Writing advice: Product interface text\n  * Writing process\n    1.

However in the case of\nproduct writing for non-writers, this is not often a very useful starting point.\nThe Culture Amp Design Principles, developed in light of the Culture Amp values,\nare a better one.\n\n| Design principle      | All interface text must be…                   |\n| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |\n| Nurture to grow       | Guiding: don\'t presume.                       |\n| We\'re all human       | Human: be understanding and empathetic.       |\n| Honest and purposeful | Clear: be direct, not subtle.                 |\n| Consider everyone     | Inclusive: write at a grade 7 level or lower. |\n\nEvery time you write or review product text, ask yourself if it reflects the\nfour qualities listed above. If it doesn’t, you can improve it using the advice\nin this guide.\n\n> **_Importantly_**, these principles encourage us to:\n>\n> * refer to the user (you) and ourselves (we) in the interface and product\n>   communications\n> * write as if we are speaking to the people using the product.\n>\n> This helps us avoid “computer speak”. For example, 16 items deleted becomes\n> You deleted 16 items.\n\nIf you’re writing longer text and you’re wondering about tone, the Brand tone of\nvoice is:\n\n* Friendly but not casual\n* Educational but not dull\n* Expert but not dictatorial\n* Familiar but not inappropriate\n* Positive but not unopinionated\n* Vulnerable but not hesitant\n* Warm but not mushy\n* Fun but not childish\n* A community but not a clique.\n\nSelect from these to shape the tone depending on the use case and persona.\nAlways keep in mind the many languages into which the text will be translated,\nand the cultures in which it will be used. For advice on internationalization of\ntext, see the [IBM Globalization guidelines][1]\n\n[1]: (http://www-01.ibm.com/software/globalization/guidelines/guideb.html).\n\nAlso, if you apply Brand tone of voice, be sure to check what you’ve written\nwith a Product Writer.\n\n## Moments of delight and language\n\nIf you want to use language to help build a “moment of delight”, check it with a\nProduct Writer. Don’t rely solely on language to create a moment of delight,\notherwise you risk jarring the user experience.\n\n![Screenshot of culture amp "Delete Survey" confirmation where the user must type "SMASH!" to confirm](img/smash.png)\n\nDelight is usually best engendered through the combination of design,\ninteraction and language used in a way that consistently reflects the brand and\nculture.\n\n### Asking Product Writers for help\n\nIf you’re in doubt about anything you write, or anything in this guide, have the\ncourage to be vulnerable and ask a Product Writer. When you’re writing\nhigh-stakes text, or text that requires the application of brand tone, you\n_definitely_ need to have a writer involved.\n\nUsing this guide and the associated training, you should be able to develop\nbasic interface text without too much trouble, including labels, button names,\nand so on. You may need some – or more – writer involvement on longer text, like\nerrors and emails.\n\n## Writing advice: Product interface text\n\n### Writing process\n\n1. #### Understand the context\n\n   Where does the text appear in the user flow? What’s just happened? How did\n   the user get here? What else in the current context gives the user cues and\n   clues about possible next steps?\n\n2. #### Think about users and cultures\n\n   Consider the personas (and actual people) using the interface, and the\n   languages and cultures into which it will be translated. That means you’ll\n   avoid:\n\n   * jargon\n   * colloquialisms\n   * references to popular culture and in-jokes\n   * humour (unless you’re working with a Product Writer)\n   * language that suggests or references violence or destruction.\n\n   Next, identify likely audience feelings at this moment in the UX. What are\n   they trying to get done and how do they feel about it?\n\n3. #### Check the component specifications\n\n   The Culture Amp design team has set specifications for certain interface\n   components (buttons, tooltips, and so on). Check the Component Specifications\n   section of this guide to see if the component you’re working on is defined\n   there. If it is, you’ll need to write to those specifications.\n\n4. #### Write the message\n\n   The message is the key information you need to communicate at this moment to\n   help the user achieve their objective with Culture Amp.\n\n   Ask yourself:\n\n   1. What’s the goal of this text? What is its role in helping the user achieve\n      their larger objective within Culture Amp?\n   2. At its _most basic_, what’s the message we need to communicate? Write this\n      as if you were _speaking_ to the person trying to use the product.\n   3. What in 2) is not communicated elsewhere on the page/in the context? The\n      point here is to avoid stating the already-obvious, but take care to\n      consider non-visual users who may not be able to see other visual cues.\n      Consider the example below. Here, the heading puts the action into the\n      continuous tense — it’s happening now. We have the little three-step\n      process diagram at top-right. And we have the three bullets (which change\n      colour as the progress bar gets filled in and each one is completed). In\n      this context, the word “currently” and the line “What we’re processing”\n      seem unnecessary.\n\n   ![Analyze Imports](./img/analyze-imports.png)\n\n   With your answers to the three questions above, write down what the text\n   _must_ communicate in fewer than 10 words (obviously for buttons and labels\n   the text will be _much_ shorter).\n\n   Don’t write like a marketer. Use plain English. If it helps, imagine you’re\n   explaining to someone who doesn’t speak English as a first language – not\n   because our users can’t speak English, but because you’re probably very close\n   to the product, and you’ve likely been looking at this process or interaction\n   for a while. You want to get outside that mindset to make the text work.\n\n5. #### Tighten up your text\n\n   Revise the message by asking yourself these questions. Note that you’ll\n   likely need to balance these points against one another to arrive at a\n   best-case scenario for each piece of text.\n\n   These guidelines are summarized for easy reference in the\n   [Product Writing Checklist](TODO)\n\n   1. **Does your text talk about what the user has just done?** They already\n      know that, so you can cut that part.\n\n   2. **Does your text talk in terms of the product, or descriptions?** Put the\n      focus on people and actions instead.\n\n      * **Needs work:** The latest import of employee data was successful. You\n        can now manage your surveys or employee data.\n      * **Good:** Your import worked. Now, go to your surveys or employee data.\n\n   3. **Does your text talk in the negative?** Rephrase it to the positive\n      wherever possible.\n\n      * **Needs work:** Don’t click Delete unless...\n      * **Good:** If you click Delete you will...\n\n   4. **Is your text polite?** As with the examples above, polite text is\n      usually longer than plain language. Opt for the plainest language you can\n      write. Plain doesn’t mean rude.\n\n      * **Needs work:** Sorry, that didn’t work. Please try again, and if you’re\n        still having problems feel free to get in touch with us at\n        support@cultureamp.com\n      * **Good:** Sorry, that didn’t work. Try again, or contact us at\n        support@cultureamp.com.\n\n   5. **Shorten or break up sentences wherever you can.**\n\n      * **Needs work:** Along with options to launch, share and complete\n        multiple 360 processes, you can now change due dates, set reminders, or\n        delete multiple 360s in just one click!\n      * **Good:** It’s now easier than ever to manage multiple 360 processes.\n        Change due dates, set reminders, and delete multiple 360s in one click.\n\n   6. **Check each word** and make sure it aligns with contextual interface text\n      and the product lexicon:\n\n      * Use consistent capitalization and spelling.\n      * Use consistent nomenclature. In this example, “apply” would ideally be\n        “review” because we’re at the Review step in the import process, and the\n        heading reflects this.\n\n        ![Screenshot of import modal](img/apply-review.png)\n\n      - Check that your text has the same grammatical structure as parallel text\n        on the page (that is, text that serves the same purpose in the same\n        level of the interface). For example, in the form below, the final\n        heading (and button text) should ideally reflect the verb-noun structure\n        of the other two. It could read: Extract Survey Data.\n\n        ![Screenshot of survey admin](img/verb-noun.png)\n\n      - Remove any redundancy. For example, in the warning below, “no longer” is\n        redundant in the context of a reference to the “future”. We could\n        rephrase this to: If you delete a demographic, it won’t be available to\n        use in future surveys, but it will stay in existing surveys.\n\n        ![Screenshot of Culture Amp warning](img/no-longer.png)\n\n      - If, as you write, you need to associate particular concepts with a\n        feature (e.g. working with/managing “batches” of 360° processes), choose\n        language that you can use consistently, and ask the Product Writer to\n        add it to the product lexicon so that it is used consistently.\n\n   7. **For words that don’t appear elsewhere in the interface, try to find a\n      synonym that’s simpler** and has fewer syllables. Use a thesaurus (e.g.\n      Apple thesaurus) if you need to.\n\n      * **Needs work:** We’ve been notified and are investigating the issue.\n\n      * **Good:** We’re working on the problem now.\n\n   8. **Check the tense.** Make sure that the text maintains the same tense\n      throughout, unless a change in tense is needed. Present tense is most\n      commonly needed for interface text. Change tense (e.g. from present to\n      future text) only when it’s needed (e.g. when you’re talking about the\n      consequences of an action).\n\n      * **Needs work:** We’ve added some features that would make it easy for\n        you to manage 360 surveys at scale.\n      * **Good:** New features make it easier for you to manage 360 surveys at\n        scale.\n\n   9. **Remove -ing verbs** (gerunds and continuous constructions).\n\n      Ing verbs tend to add syllables and complicate grammar, which often raises\n      the reading level of text for no benefit. These verbs fall into 2\n      categories:\n\n      * Continuous verbs, which we use to describe actions that have begun but\n        haven’t finished (e.g. We’re saving your changes).\n      * Gerunds, or ing-verbs acting as nouns. (e.g. Saving will make your\n        changes live.)\n\n      Continuous verbs are fine if you’re alerting people about a process that’s\n      in progress. In all other cases, reword text to avoid verbs that end in\n      ing.\n\n      * **Needs work:** Deleting survey name will also delete any associated\n        responses and reporting data.\n      * **Good:** If you delete survey name, the survey and its data will be\n        gone forever.\n\n   10. **Make sure the text is active, not passive.**\n\n       **TODO** figure out how to represent this section without relying on\n       colour\n\n       (Jason struggles to read it because colour blindness)\n\n       There are two kinds of construction in English: active and passive.\n\n       Active sentences have an actor, an action, and a thing that receives the\n       action: The cat sat on the mat.\n\n       Passive sentences demote the actor (or remove them entirely) to\n       prioritize either the action, or the thing that’s receiving action: The\n       mat was sat on [by the cat].\n\n       As you can see, passive sentences tend to be longer. They’re also\n       murkier. Let’s look at the previous example, which is passive:\n\n       Deleting survey name will also delete any associated responses and\n       reporting data.\n\n       To fix it, we can add the actor and make “deleting” the action (that is,\n       a verb) rather than the name of a task (that is, a gerund).\n\n       If you delete survey name you’ll also delete its responses and report\n       data.\n\n   11. **Check that you’ve used American English.** See the General Styles for\n       details.\n   12. **Check that your usage of Culture Amp language aligns with the Product\n       Lexicon.**\n   13. **Check punctuation** and any other questions against the information in\n       this style guide and the AP Stylebook.\n   14. **Check the readability of your text** at\n       https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/read-able/check.php, or on your own copy\n       of [Hemingway for desktop](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/desktop.html). It\n       should be at grade 7 level or below. To reduce the reading level:\n       * shorten sentences\n       * make sentences active\n       * use simpler words\n       * cut words.\n   15. **Show your text to a friend** in design for a sanity check.\n\nFor tips on user-testing interface text, see\nhttps://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2015/07/01/what-does-this-mean-tips-for-testing-your-words/\n\n## Writing advice: Transactional email\n\n### Purposes\n\nTransactional emails are usually used:\n\n* to alert users about changes to their permissions/capabilities\n* to remind users to take a survey\n* to inform users that an auto-upload has completed.\n\nNote that occasionally email will be sent through Intercom to notify people who\nhaven’t logged into the platform for weeks about a piece of news.\n\n### General guidelines\n\nTo write transactional emails, follow the writing process below. Keep these\npoints in mind:\n\n* Prioritize the action you want the reader to take. Make this the focus of your\n  email.\n* Prioritize the reader. Don’t tell them, “we’ve done this.” Tell them, “now you\n  can do this.”\n* Avoid providing advice or instructions, either for things like meeting with\n  employees, or how to use the interface, in the email itself. Instead, create a\n  piece of Academy content that can be complete, and to which you can link from\n  the email.\n* Do _everything you can_ to reduce formality, reduce the reading level of your\n  text, and make it read naturally. If you’re having trouble doing that, paste\n  it sentence by sentence into the\n  [text analysis tool](https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/read-able/) (or use\n  Hemingway) so you can identify and improve the specific ones that are\n  problematic.\n* Try to avoid using the kinds of words that spam filters focus on. Check your\n  message against\n  [a list like this one](https://prospect.io/blog/455-email-spam-trigger-words-avoid-2017/).\n\n### Writing process\n\n* Identify the action you’re trying to generate, considering the user, their\n  point in the process, and so on. If all you’re doing is confirming something,\n  first ask yourself if an email is actually necessary — can you confirm\n  whatever the user has requested in the interface?\n* Write the messaging _just_ for that action or confirmation (ideally 5 words or\n  fewer).\n* Use that messaging as the basis for writing the email subject line (5 words or\n  fewer).\n* Insert a greeting between the subject line and the call to action.\n* Write why that action is needed (ideally no more than a sentence).\n* Offer help with the action (or confirmation) – either link to the Academy or\n  include the support email address, or both.\n* Write a signoff.\n* Tighten up the text. Use the advice in Step 5 in the writing advice for\n  Product interface text to help.\n* Apply the Product lexicon and General styles included in this guide. If you\n  need more information, check the AP Stylebook. If, as you write, you need to\n  associate particular concepts with a feature (e.g. working with/managing\n  “batches” of 360° processes), choose language that you can use consistently,\n  and ask a Product Writer to add it to the product lexicon so that it is used\n  consistently.\n* Check the readability of your text at\n  https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/read-able/check.php, or on your own copy of\n  [Hemingway for desktop](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/desktop.html). It should\n  be at grade 7 level or below. To reduce the reading level:\n  * shorten sentences\n  * make sentences active\n  * use simpler words\n  * cut words.\n* Proofread and then show your system emails to a Product Writer, ideally before\n  you make them live.\n\n## Writing advice: Intercom messages\n\n### Purposes\n\nIntercom messages are used primarily:\n\n* to alert users to a system outage in which the platform remains accessible\n* to reassure users previously alerted about an outage that the service has\n  resumed\n* to tell users about a coming feature change so that they can choose to opt out\n  if they wish\n* to tell users about a feature change that has taken place\n* to remind users about regular actions (like maintenance) that will make the\n  product, or parts of it, unavailable\n* to solicit quantitative feedback from users about a feature, where you don’t\n  have the time or contacts to work with the Customer team to do this.\n\nAs a new feature is progressively rolled out, funnelled Intercom messages about\nit can also be valuable if used judiciously.\n\nTo communicate about launches through Intercom, speak to Product Marketing.\n\n### General guidelines\n\nGuidelines for writing Intercom messages:\n\n* Focus on communicating the action/s the user needs to take now.\n* The shorter the message, the better.\n* Include one small image if you need to highlight a change to the interface.\n* Prioritize the reader. Don’t tell them, “we’ve done this.” Tell them, “now you\n  can do this.”\n* Where possible, display the primary call to action on a button, unless you’re\n  linking to a website (e.g. the Academy).\n* Use the thumbs up/down tool to gauge broad user sentiment about the message.\n* Don’t engage with users in a chat thread within Intercom.\n* Have another PM, or a Product Writer, read over the text for tone before you\n  make it live.\n\n### Writing process\n\n* Identify the action you’re trying to generate (considering the user, their\n  point in the process, etc.).\n* Write the messaging for that action (ideally 5 words or fewer).\n* Above this, greet the user and say why you’re interrupting them (one\n  sentence).\n* After your action message, provide essential supporting detail (ideally one\n  sentence).\n* Offer help with the action – either link to the Academy or include the support\n  email address, or both.\n* Tighten up the text. Use the advice in Step 5 in the writing advice for\n  Product interface text to help.\n* Apply the Product lexicon and General styles included in this guide. If you\n  need more information, check the AP Stylebook. If, as you write, you need to\n  associate particular concepts with a feature (e.g. working with/managing\n  “batches” of 360° processes), choose language that you can use consistently,\n  and ask a Product Writer to add it to the product lexicon so that it is used\n  consistently.\n* Check the readability of your text at\n  https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/read-able/check.php, or on your own copy of\n  [Hemingway for desktop](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/desktop.html). It should\n  be at grade 7 level or below. To reduce the reading level:\n  * shorten sentences\n  * make sentences active\n  * use simpler words\n  * cut words.\n* Proofread the message, then have another PM proofread your work.\n\n## Writing advice: Academy articles\n\n### Purpose\n\nCulture Amp Academy articles help customers get things done with Culture Amp.\n\nAvoid writing Academy articles as product documentation. Consider every content\nitem a tool to help someone use the product to achieve a goal.\n\n### General guidelines\n\nWhen you’re writing help content:\n\n* Write step-by-step, numbered instructions.\n* Write in short sentences and paragraphs.\n* Use lists to present alternatives or options within a step.\n* Start from the same point in the software every time (e.g. agree between\n  product teams that Step 1 is always Log into Culture Amp, and subsequent steps\n  show how to access the functionality in question from there).\n* Make sure that the text maintains the same tense throughout, unless a change\n  in tense is needed. Change tense (e.g. from present to future tense) only when\n  it’s needed – for example, when you’re talking about the consequences of an\n  action.\n* Use images and ALT text wherever they logically make sense.\n\n* Use a blue arrow to highlight important features of product screen captures.\n\n  * **This style is pending designer review.**\n\n* If you add See Also links, consider the next steps a user is likely to take\n  after they use the help article you’re writing.\n* If you include a video, include a transcript of it.\n* Don’t forget to\n  [maintain your articles in the Academy](https://academy.cultureamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205062809-Using-Academy-maintaining-articles)\n  over time.\n\n### Writing process\n\n1. #### Consider users and context\n\n   Orient yourself to the user’s mindset. How do they feel when they reach this\n   piece of help content? Consider their stresses, frustrations and desires in\n   this moment.\n\n2. #### Identify their goal within the product\n\n   Define what the user wants to do in around five words.\n\n   Shape this into a title for your help article. In doing this:\n\n   * consider the title’s searchability and the natural language of users\n   * consider the scannability of the title in a list of categorised articles\n   * ensure How-to titles begin with a present-simple-tense verb:\n     * **Needs work:** Running Onboard & Exit Surveys\n     * **Good:** Run Onboard and Exit Surveys\n   * ensure titles are written in sentence case with appropriate product- and\n     feature-name capitalization.\n\n3. #### Map the process to achieve that goal\n\n   Map the process as a series of numbered steps. Allocate a new step for each\n   interaction a user must make (e.g. each click, each\n   field-completion-and-click, and so on).\n\n   * **Use an image** to clarify any point that might confuse users.\n   * **Use subheadings** to break up parallel chunks of information that must\n     logically appear in the same help article.\n   * **Use a Note** to highlight information which is not a direct part of the\n     process of achieving the user’s goal, but will help them complete that\n     process.\n\n4. #### Tighten up the text\n\n* Shorten or break up sentences wherever you can.\n* Put the focus on users and actions.\n* Is your text talking in the negative? Rephrase it to the positive wherever\n  possible.\n  * **Needs work:** Don’t click Delete unless….\n  * **Good:** Click Delete to...\n* Talk in the singular unless the help is specifically focused on completing\n  multiple actions, or acting on multiple items at once.\n  * **Needs work:** To archive surveys...\n  * **Good:** To archive a survey…\n* Check each word and make sure it aligns with contextual interface text and the\n  product lexicon. Note that if, as you write, you need to associate particular\n  concepts with a feature (e.g. working with/managing “batches” of 360°\n  processes), choose language that you can use consistently, and ask a Product\n  Writer to add it to the product lexicon so that it is used consistently.\n* For non-contextual words, try to find a synonym that’s simpler and has fewer\n  syllables. Use a thesaurus (e.g. Apple thesaurus) if you need to.\n* Remove ing verbs (gerunds and continuous constructions). See this point in the\n  writing advice for Product interface text for details.\n* Make sure the text is active, not passive. See this point in the writing\n  advice for Product interface text for details.\n* Check that you’ve used American English.\n* Check punctuation and any other questions against the information in this\n  style guide.\n* Apply the Product lexicon and General styles included in this guide. If you\n  need more information, check the AP Stylebook. If, as you write, you need to\n  associate particular concepts with a feature (e.g. working with/managing\n  “batches” of 360° processes), choose language that you can use consistently,\n  and ask a Product Writer to add it to the product lexicon so that it is used\n  consistently.\n* Check the readability of your text at\n  https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/read-able/check.php, or on your own copy of\n  [Hemingway for desktop](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/desktop.html). It should\n  be at grade 7 level or below. To reduce the reading level:\n  * shorten sentences\n  * make sentences active\n  * use simpler words\n  * cut words.\n* Proofread the message, then have another PM proofread your work.\n\n## Product lexicon\n\n**Info:** As of November 2017, Product Managers and the\n[Product Marketing](https://cultureamp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PRODMARKETING/overview)\nteam are working on the product lexicon.\n\n##### Modules, Plans, Tiers\n\nCulture Amp is a platform with three modules: Employee Engagement, Employee\nExperience, and Employee Effectiveness. You can subscribe to two plans, which\ncontain different modules. Each plan contains three tiers, which dictate service\nlevels, product inclusions, and price.\n\n## Component Specifications\n\n**Info:** Images to come\n\n### Buttons\n\nMaximum character length: 2-3 words. Avoid phrases.\n\nCapitalization: Sentence case.\n\nPunctuation: No finishing punctuation.\n\nOther: Put verbs first; use only verbs where possible. Let the button identify\nthe action the user is taking. An angle bracket before or after the text shows\nwhich direction in the process the user’s click on the button will take them.\n\n**Warning:** The “backward” and “forward” directions for arrows are dependent on\nthe writing direction (specifically, they are reversed in right-to-left writing\nsystems).\n\n* **Good:** Create survey\n* **Needs work:** New survey\n\n![Button saying "Restart import"](img/btn1.png)\n![Button saying "Review"](img/btn2.png)\n\n### Notifications\n\nMaximum length: ideally 90 characters for single-line and toast notifications.\nIf the text is longer, use a multi-line notification broken at 90 characters.\n\nCapitalization: Sentence case.\n\nPunctuation: As usual for prose.\n\nOther: Must have a heading which reflects the key message of the text. That is,\nit may say less than the text. It shouldn’t simply identify the topic of the\nnotification; it must give the user some indication of why the information is\nimportant.\n\n* **Good:** Your questions have moved\n* **Needs work:** Deleted section and moved questions\n\n### Not Applicable (NA) values\n\nUse NA, without spaces, slashes or stops, when the function or data are not\napplicable.\n\nSee also **Nil values**.\n\n### Nil values\n\nA nil value is a value for which there is no result or value.\n\nNil values are shown as an en-dash (–) presented as an icon. Refer to the\nComponent Library for details.\n\nSee also **Not Applicable (NA) values**.\n\n### Tooltips\n\nMaximum length: depends on the tooltip’s purpose.\n\nCapitalization: Sentence case.\n\nPunctuation: Explained below.\n\nOther:\n\nTooltips are used for two purposes:\n\n* To explain an element of the interface.\n\n  ![Tooltip saying "Feedback is complete"](img/tooltip1.png)\n\n  Maximum length: 4 words.\n\n  Punctuation: No finishing punctuation\n\n* To give guidance on concepts inherent in the product.\n\n  ![Tooltip with "Survey Administrator" heading and large paragraph"](img/tooltip2.png)\n\n  Maximum length: 35 words, including optional title.\n\n  Punctuation: Where the tooltip comprises a full sentence (or more), use\n  finishing punctuation.\n\n* Other: contains a header that reflects the topic of the guidance.\n\n### Empty states\n\n**Warning:** These guidelines require confirmation and clarification.\n\nMaximum character length: N/A\n\nCapitalization: Sentence case.\n\nPunctuation: As usual for prose.\n\nOther:\n\n* The empty state displays a sentence explaining why there’s nothing to show.\n* If the message displays on its own page, it includes:\n  * a subheading\n  * an explanation of what will appear on the page, and when\n  * a back link to take the user to the previous page\n  * a line drawing or sketch.\n* If it’s practical, include an explanation to the user about what to do if they\n  want to see data in the currently-empty state.\n\n### Errors\n\nMaximum character length: N/A\n\nCapitalization: Sentence case.\n\nPunctuation: As usual for prose.\n\nOther: Say sorry, and lead with that, not the error number (if there is one).\nDon’t tell users not to worry. Don’t use “please.” Don’t be cute (unless you’re\nworking with a Product Writer).\n\nProvide options, as appropriate, to:\n\n* try again\n* go home\n* go back\n* visit/contact support.\n\n### Page titles\n\nMaximum character length: N/A\n\nCapitalization: Title case. Don’t capitalise articles (a, the, an) or\nprepositions (e.g. in, on, at).\n\nPunctuation: No finishing punctuation.\n\nOther: Keep them short and direct. Focus on nouns; page titles are not calls to\naction, nor are they descriptions.\n\n### Placeholder text\n\nMaximum character length: N/A\n\nCapitalization: Sentence case.\n\nPunctuation: No finishing punctuation.\n\nOther: Placeholder text is used in any form field which isn’t prefilled on\npageload. It is always preceded by: e.g. in lowercase, regardless of the fact\nthat nothing precedes it. Common patterns we use for placeholder text are:\n\n* Email addresses: contact@example.com\n  * **Georgina says:** This is not shown in the example below but I think it\n    would be a good generic one to use, rather than changing the placeholder\n    email depending on the type of email we need.\n* Names: Given-name Family-name (as “First name” and “last name” are reversed in\n  different cultures).\n* Dates: mmm, dd, yyyy\n* Generic: example label; example title, example description\n\n![Example input field showing placeholder which says "e.g. support@example.com"](img/placeholder.png)\n\n### Onboarding messages\n\n_Undefined as yet._\n\n## General styles\n\nFor full details of general styles, refer to the AP Stylebook online. Each\nProduct Manager has a license, as does Product Marketing.\n\n##### American spellings\n\nIf you have a word whose spelling you need to confirm, use\nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/ or the Apple dictionary. The first spelling\ndisplayed in both is the dominant American English form.\n\nCheck https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/spelling/british-and-spelling to\nunderstand what kinds of words have regionalized spellings.\n\n##### and/or\n\nAnd is used for addition. Or is used to introduce an alternative, that is, in\ncases where only one option can be selected.\n\n* **Needs work:** Please see our website for up-to-date pricing plans, or you\n  can contact someone to arrange a demonstration.\n* **Good:** See our pricing plans and contact us to arrange a demonstration.\n\n##### &\n\nAn ampersand is included in some product feature names, and must be included in\nthem every time, in every instance.\n\nOtherwise, don’t use ampersands in prose, nor in titles or labels or other text.\n\n##### Apostrophes\n\nFor a singular possessive, the apostrophe comes before the s: the employee’s\nreview.\n\nFor a plural possessive, it comes after the s: the employees’ change rooms.\n\nIn possessives forms of plurals that don’t simply take an s in the plural, the\napostrophe goes before the s: women’s, children’s.\n\n##### Bold text\n\nSee also [References to interface elements](TODO).\n\nUnless you’re referring to interface elements, avoid making text bold. Do not\nuse bold text or talking marks for emphasis, nor to draw users’ attention to\nparticular text. Instead, rewrite the text to highlight the part you want to\ndraw attention to. Perhaps consider a list (see also Lists).\n\n##### Capitalization\n\nNames of product features must take initial capitals in all cases: Account\nDemographics, not Account demographics.\n\nCapitalise proper nouns (e.g. names of cities and people) as per the AP\nStylebook, and Culture Amp products and features only as they appear in the\nProduct Lexicon.\n\nAvoid unnecessary capitalization, for example, using initial capitals on words\nyou want to emphasize, or feel are important.\n\n##### Colons and semicolons\n\nA colon introduces a list (see also Lists). Colons also separate hours from\nminutes when we’re talking about time (see also Times).\n\nYou’ll probably never need to use a semicolon.\n\n##### Commas\n\nRefer to the AP Stylebook.\n\n##### Contractions\n\nUse common contractions whenever you can: you’ll, we’ll, it’s, you’re.\n\nDon’t use contractions that aren’t commonly written: this’ll, we’ll’ve.\n\n##### Dashes\n\nUse **spaced en dashes**, like – this.\n\n##### Dates\n\nFor dates, use this format: `Mmm DD, YYYY` or **Jun 12, 2017**. This is\nconsistent with our employee data import practices (which may change in the\nfuture). Including the month in letters instead of numbers supports\ninternationalization for our global audience by removing the ambiguity in dates\nlike 06/12/2017 – is this referring to DD/MM/YYYY or MM/DD/YYYY?\n\nFor dates that include days 1-9 of the month, the day takes a single digit: Jun\n3, 2017.\n\n##### Dates and times\n\nWe use the user’s local time without a time zone in all cases where that’s clear\nand unambiguous. The examples below show time zones for completeness.\n\nFor dates and times, use the above considerations and combine like this: **Oct\n17, 2017 at 4:00 p.m. (EST).**\n\nFor dates that include days 1-9 of the month, the day takes a single digit:\n**Oct 7, 2017 at 4:00 p.m. (EST).**\n\n##### e.g.\n\nSee also i.e.\n\ne.g. can be used to introduce an example or a suggestion within a sentence.\nDon’t use it to present a recommendation.\n\nIf you want to use e.g. at the beginning of a sentence, don’t. Instead, write\n“For example” or “One example is.”\n\n##### Ellipses\n\nEllipses have two purposes. They’re used:\n\n* when a word in the interface needs to be truncated due to space constraints\n* to indicate that a menu item will take a user to a new screen.\n\nOtherwise, avoid using ellipses. They wear thin quickly.\n\n##### etc.\n\nUse “and so on” rather than etc.\n\n##### Exclamation marks\n\nAvoid using these. They wear thin quickly.\n\n##### Gender\n\nAvoid using gendered language. Refer to “people”, and “the person” rather than\n“he or she.”\n\n**Note**: _This may need to change depending on what language the PMs choose to\nuse to refer to users._\n\nNote that gender describes the characteristics that a society or culture\ndelineates as masculine or feminine, while sex refers to biological differences;\nchromosomes, hormonal profiles, internal and external sex organs.\n([Source](http://www.med.monash.edu.au/gendermed/sexandgender.html).)\n\n##### Headings and titles\n\nPage titles in the product take title case.\n\nTitles in the Academy take sentence case, without finishing punctuation.\n\n##### i.e.\n\nSee also **e.g.**\n\nUse “that is” rather than i.e.\n\n##### Internationalization of text\n\nCulture Amp is already translated into numerous languages, and the scope for\nthis work will only increase. IBM presents good\n[guidelines for writing text that is to be translated](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/globalization/guidelines/guideb.html).\n\n##### Links\n\nMake link text communicate information, so that it’s scannable and accessible.\n\n* **Needs work:** You can see our reports with some sample data here.\n\n* **Good:** Our new Employee Data Import Wizard ships on Monday.\n\nIf a link appears at the end of a sentence, make sure the sentence has a period\nwhich is _not_ part of the link.\n\n##### Lists\n\nStandardize the grammatical structure of list items.\n\nIf the list items are full sentences, give each one sentence case and finishing\npunctuation.\n\nIf the list items are not grammatically complete sentences:\n\n* don’t give them initial capitals or finishing punctuation\n* make sure the initial word in each list item follows on from the stem sentence\n  (that is, the sentence that introduces your list)\n* give the final item a period.\n\nBulleted lists are a good way of making paragraph text scannable, as in this\nexample:\n\n> Hi <name>, Good news. You can now manage 360 surveys in batches:\n>\n> In one click, you can:\n>\n> * send reminders\n> * change due dates, and\n> * delete multiple 360 surveys.\n>\n> Got questions? Contact us at support@cultureamp.com.\n\n##### Login/login\n\nSee **Two words or one?**\n\n##### Not Applicable/Nil values\n\nNot Applicable (NA) and Nil values are represented differently in the interface.\n\nSee the Component Specifications in this guide for details.\n\n##### Numbers\n\nShould you use numbers or words in prose? Numbers.\n\n##### Okay\n\nIf you use it, use the full word, not ok or o.k.\n\n##### Oxford comma\n\nCulture Amp refers to the AP Stylebook for general styles, and the AP Stylebook\nadvocates against the use of the Oxford comma. As in, no.\n\n##### Paragraphs\n\nStart a new paragraph with each new point or thought.\n\n* **Paragraph needs work:**\n\n  > The Survey & Interview Workflow is used where you want the option for\n  > someone to follow up with the employee for an onboard/exit interview once\n  > they have completed their survey, and have this captured in Culture Amp. It\n  > provides the opportunity for a more detailed exploration of the employee’s\n  > responses and therefore the possibility of direct intervention or action\n  > based on the employee’s response. Some people use the basic setup and do\n  > occasional interviews but the Survey & Interview Workflow is used when this\n  > is a standard approach. The Survey & Interview Workflow introduces the\n  > concept of an \'Interviewer\'. The Interviewer is an individual who is\n  > responsible for managing and potentially reviewing responses from the\n  > onboard/exit process. This is typically the employee’s manager or someone\n  > from HR. Interviewers and Administrators can review the employee\'s\n  > individual responses prior to the interview to capture any notes and\n  > prepare. The Survey & Interview Workflow is illustrated below.\n\n* **Good paragraphs _(note the text does not follow the advice in this\n  guide)_:**\n\n  > The Survey & Interview Workflow is used where you want the option for\n  > someone to follow up with the employee for an onboard/exit interview once\n  > they have completed their survey, and have this captured in Culture Amp.\n  >\n  > It provides the opportunity for a more detailed exploration of the\n  > employee’s responses and therefore the possibility of direct intervention or\n  > action based on the employee’s response. Some people use the basic setup and\n  > do occasional interviews but the Survey & Interview Workflow is used when\n  > this is a standard approach.\n  >\n  > The Survey & Interview Workflow introduces the concept of an \'Interviewer\'.\n  > The Interviewer is an individual who is responsible for managing and\n  > potentially reviewing responses from the onboard/exit process. This is\n  > typically the employee’s manager or someone from HR. Interviewers and\n  > Administrators can review the employee\'s individual responses prior to the\n  > interview to capture any notes and prepare.\n  >\n  > The Survey & Interview Workflow is illustrated below.\n\n##### Personal pronouns\n\nSee also **Us and them.**\n\nUse personal pronouns where they’re needed. They’re a good way to make prose\nconversational, put it in the active voice, and avoid “computer-speak.” But for\nlabels, for example, you may be able to avoid them entirely (e.g. instead of My\nProfile, just call it Profile). Where you use them will likely depend on use\ncases and their implications.\n\n* I – reserved for user actions where ownership/agency is important. Eg. I agree\n  to the terms of service.\n* You – should be the most common personal pronoun. In general, text should talk\n  about users, not Culture Amp.\n* We – used where the user is waiting on Culture Amp to do something, or a\n  problem the user is experiencing is our fault. For example, a waiting message\n  that talks about an ongoing process might explain that “we’re” doing\n  something.\n\n##### Please\n\nIt’s rarely necessary to say please. Users don’t notice if it’s not there. In\nthe interests of keeping text concise and direct, the preference is to omit it,\nparticularly in interface text.\n\n##### References to interface elements\n\nYou may need to refer to elements of the interface in emails, Academy articles\nand intercom messages.\n\nMake the reference to the label that appears in the interface bold and\nitalicized. Or, in the Academy, red and italicized.\n\n**Note:** _This style is pending designer review._\n\nDescribe the interaction as simply as possible: click, drag, select, highlight.\n\nUse the most active and clearest verb you can.\n\n* **Good:** If none of the existing surveys or templates suit your needs, click\n  **Create Blank Survey** to make a new one.\n\n* **Good:** Can’t find a survey that suits your need? Click **Create Blank\n  Survey** to make a new one.\n\n* **Needs work:** If no existing surveys and templates really suit what you\'re\n  looking for, you can make your own survey using the **Create Blank Survey**\n  button.\n\n##### Sex\n\nSee **Gender**.\n\n##### Sign in/signin\n\nSee **Two words or one?**\n\n##### Slashes\n\nIn prose, use the word “or” instead of a slash.\n\nUse stops instead of a slash in a contraction (see also **Stops**).\n\n##### Stops\n\nStops are used between e.g., p.m., and a.m., and after contractions like Ms.,\nvs. and etc.\n\nThey’re not used for capitalized abbreviations like EST, PDT, or NA.\n\n##### Times\n\nFor times, use the user’s local time without a time zone if that’s clear and\nunambiguous. If it’s necessary to distinguish the user’s time zone from others\n(the most likely scenario), show local time with time zone: `4:00 p.m. (EST)`.\nFor _midnight_/_noon_, use the words instead of awkward timestamps (00:00/12:00\nor 12:00 a.m.).\n\n* Use **non-breaking spaces** between the time and the meridiem a.m. or p.m.\n  marker. If possible, use non-breaking spaces between the meridiem a.m. or p.m.\n  marker and time zone as well.\n* A **colon** separates hours from minutes.\n* **Time ranges use spaced en dashes**, e.g. 8:30 a.m. – 9:45 a.m.\n* **Time ranges in a sentence use words to separate them**: Automatically run\n  sync between midnight and 3:00 a.m. (PDT)\n  * Note: this is a _window_ of time so the sync could occur at any time within\n    that window. If the sync started at midnight and continued until 3:00 a.m.,\n    then it should say “Automatically run sync **from** midnight **to** 3:00\n    a.m. (PDT).”\n\n##### Two words or one?\n\nIf you’re worried about whether words like log in, log out, sign in and sign out\nare two words or one, they’re both.\n\nThe single word login is used as a noun: You need a login. The single word can\nalso be used as an adjective: Rewrite the login CTA. The two-word version is\nused as a phrasal verb, to talk about the action: You need to log in.\n\nEvery day is two words unless you’re using it as an adjective: an everyday\naction.\n\n##### Us and them (and we, you, they, I)\n\nSee also **Personal Pronouns**.\n\n_They_ are more important than _we_ are. In other words, always prioritize the\nreader. Don’t tell them, “we’ve changed this.” Tell them, “now you can do this.”\n\n* **Needs work**: We’ve added some features to make it easy for you to manage\n  360 surveys at scale.\n\n* **Good**: You can now manage 360 surveys in batches.\n';
